2. **Install Photodiodes**:
   - Place photodiodes in positions to receive light signals from the LEDs.
   - Connect photodiodes to the microcontroller input pins.

3. **Microcontroller Setup**:
   - Connect the microcontroller to the LED circuit and photodiodes.
   - Upload the firmware to read the photodiode signals and convert them into key presses.

### Transmission Path Setup

1. **Optical Fiber Setup**:
   - Cut optical fibers to the required lengths.
   - Connect one end of the optical fiber to the LED outputs on the keyboard.
   - Connect the other end to the inputs on the processing unit.

2. **Free Space Optics (if used)**:
   - Align lenses and mirrors to create a direct path for light signals.
   - Secure the mounts and holders to maintain alignment.

### Processing Unit Assembly

1. **Optical Logic Gates**:
   - Install optical logic gates on a suitable platform.
   - Connect outputs from the transmission path to the inputs of the logic gates.
