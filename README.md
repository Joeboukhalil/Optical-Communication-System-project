Connect photodiodes to the microcontroller input pins.

3. Microcontroller Setup:

Connect the microcontroller to the LED circuit and photodiodes.
Upload the firmware to read the photodiode signals and convert them into key presses.


Transmission Path Setup

1. Optical Fiber Setup:

Cut optical fibers to the required lengths.
Connect one end of the optical fiber to the LED outputs on the keyboard.
Connect the other end to the inputs on the processing unit.

2. Free Space Optics (if used):

Align lenses and mirrors to create a direct path for light signals.
Secure the mounts and holders to maintain alignment.
